# Hangman Game ðŸŽ®

This project is a Hangman game developed with React and TypeScript. Players try to guess words related to front-end development while avoiding too many mistakes.

## Technologies Used
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS (for styling)

## How to Play
1. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
2. The player must guess letters by pressing keys on the keyboard.
3. If the letter is in the word, it will appear in the correct position.
4. If the letter is not in the word, an error is counted.
5. The game ends when:
   - The player correctly guesses all the letters (Victory ðŸŽ‰)
   - The player reaches the maximum number of errors (Defeat ðŸ˜¢)
6. After the game ends, the player can restart the match.
